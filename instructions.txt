Seeder and Factory
	- If the companies and employees not shown in the map after the seeder and factory run, it's because
		the seeder and factory didn't save a latitude and longitude for each company and employees.
		- It will work if you manually add company or employee using the mini-crm website.

	- The same in recieving notification for all existing employee under the company. It will not work
		if you use seeder and factoy.
